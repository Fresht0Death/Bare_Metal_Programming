# Bare Metal Programming (STM32 + C)

This repository documents my progression through **bare-metal C programming on STM32**, focusing on understanding microcontrollers at the register level rather than relying on heavy abstractions.

I am following a **Udemy bare-metal embedded C course** using an STM32 Nucleo board. My workflow is intentional and structured to ensure real understanding—not just following along.

## How This Repository Is Organized

### 📁 LearningVideoCode
This folder contains code written **while following along with the Udemy course videos**.

- Used to learn concepts and peripheral setup
- Code may closely resemble instructor examples
- Focus is on understanding *why* things work

---

### 📁 Learning Projects (Rewritten From Memory)
After completing a module, I **re-implement the project from memory** a few days later.

Rules I follow:
- No copying from the course code
- Only minimal reference to documentation
- Goal is full recall and understanding

These projects represent **actual retained knowledge**, not guided repetition.

---

### 📁 Standalone Projects (Pinned)
These are projects I built **independently**, applying concepts without step-by-step guidance.

⭐ **Pinned Project:**
- `potentiometerADC`  
  - ADC configuration
  - Analog signal sampling
  - UART output for debugging
  - Written without following a tutorial line-by-line

This project marks the transition from *learning* to *building*.

## Board & Tools

- **Board:** STM32 Nucleo (STM32F4 family)
- **Language:** C
- **IDE:** STM32CubeIDE
- **Debugging:** UART serial output
- **Approach:** Bare-metal / register-level where possible

## Why Bare Metal?

The goal is to deeply understand:
- Memory-mapped registers
- Peripheral initialization
- ADCs, UART, GPIO, clocks
- What actually happens between code and hardware

This repository is about **control, predictability, and fundamentals**.

## Current Focus

- ADC
- UART
- GPIO
- Clock configuration
- Rewriting projects from memory
- Eliminating dependence on autogenerated code
